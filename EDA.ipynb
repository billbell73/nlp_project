This person will inform design, innovation, and strategy across a broad spectrum of client projects and help to advance our practice in new approaches to understanding complex problems.\\n\\nWhy is this role important for IDEO's work?\\n\\nA Computational Social Scientist makes the biggest impact by seamlessly integrating data-enabled research methods into the wider design research process. This person is able to seek out, explore, and analyze existing data sets, as well as create new ones, to generate insights for design.\\n\\nThey are responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading multidisciplinary internal and client teams through designing research plans, developing quantitative research activities and tools (survey based, sensor based, or whatever best captures the need), communicating complex technical concepts and results with clients and teams, discovering and leveraging novel public data sources, leveraging new data science methods and tools, and otherwise finding smart ways to augment qualitative research processes and insights with those that are data-enabled.\\n\\nExperience and confidence leading qualitative research and a demonstrated ability to establish empathy with participants in a variety of contexts is advantageous.\\n\\nWe don't expect all candidates to have deep experience in every aspect of what's described below, but rather look to build a team that holds strength in all of these areas. So, if you are not sure if this is a good fit, please apply and we'd be excited to learn more about your experience!\\n\\nOnce here you will:\\nUse quantitative data and insights to inform the design of products, experiences, and services\\nTeach others about how they can leverage data in their work\\nDevelop new research approaches to innovate on common market research practices\\nTell compelling stories with data\\nWhat we're looking for:\\n\\nWe're looking for candidates who have:\\n\\nStrong background in digital humanities, social sciences, behavioral science or other research-heavy science or method fields\\nFluency at writing code to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data, as well as implementing algorithms in code (but don't necessarily need to know about production software engineering)\\nExperience with designing surveys and experiments\\nExperience with quickly cleaning, analyzing and making sense of large, complex data sets\\nExperience designing and executing research plans—integrating both qualitative and quantitative research methods\\nExperience bringing data to life via visualizations and storytelling\\nExcellence in making data human, and sharing results simultaneously to those with and without deep quantitative experience\\nYou have worked with several types of the following methods:\\nNLP and/or network analysis or advanced statistical analysis\\nSocial Network Analysis (whether based on interview techniques or existing data)\\nSurvey design and analysis, including coding of online surveys using Qualtrics, or similar systems\\nSample design\\nExperimental methods (lab or natural)\\nWeb analytics and analysis\\nMeasurement design\\n\\nThrough the interview process, we'll be looking for evidence of these qualifications and we recognize these qualifications may be embodied in different ways — in fact, we get most excited by new ways people embody these that add something new to our team!\\n\\nLikewise, we don't have a specific requirement for degrees or years of work experience. However, we have observed that many of these qualifications are developed through full-time work experience (either as a data scientist or something else entirely), participation in community organizations, open-source software projects, graduate academic research, or something else.\\n\\nWhat does IDEO offer you?\\n\\nIDEO is a place unlike any other. It's a place where you can solve diverse, complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful, intelligent individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.\\n\\nCommitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\\n\\nAt IDEO, we are committed to the work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organization and in the world. We have a collective responsibility to design new systems. We have attempted to do so in some of our work, but we have not moved as quickly or as boldly as we should have. We cannot be successful until we re-examine our values, our relationships, and how we practice design itself.\\n\\nWe are committed to centering equity across IDEO in talent, training, community, design, and culture. A lot of work is being done to bring us closer to realizing this goal, but we're still early in our learning journey towards understanding what it means to become an equitable organization. As we are continually working towards and providing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we are looking for candidates who are committed to continuing this work with us.\\n\\nHow to Apply\\n\\nPlease apply with a resume and cover letter by January 31st, 2022.
