AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. For more information please visit www.astrazeneca.com.\\nDESCRIPTION\\nDS&AI is a new department at AZ, and we are embedding data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) across our R&D to enable our scientists to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines.\\nWe are currently seeking candidates who are working towards obtaining a Bachelor, Master, or Doctorate degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Maths, Bioinformatics, Quantitative Biology, Physics, Pharmacology, or Bioinformatics for an 8-12 week internship contract during the summer of 2022. A salary will be paid.\\nA number of positions are available and projects below will be allocated depending on specific candidate experiences. You need to be authorized to work in the UK to apply. Please indicate which project interests in your questionnaire.\\nProject 1: AI-Driven Therapeutic Responder/Non-Responder Prediction using Multi-modality Signature (TheraSign Project)\\nPrecise understanding of responders and non-responder populations from real-world data remains a critical aspect of drug development. In the current era of value-based contracting, understanding precise sub-population within a disease stratum remains a high-value research question. In this project, the incoming graduate student will expand our internally developed, AI-driven platform for therapeutic responder/non-responder discovery. The platform – TheraSign designed to capture the heterogeneous signature driving therapeutic responses includes three key modules: digital phenotyping, responder/non-responder definitions and predictive modelling. The incoming student will help to improve a module of choice or help to expand the application of TheraSign to apply to AZ assets. As a part of the precision medicine program, the development of TheraSign and its application is an\\nimportant milestone and the incoming student will be trained to use and apply modern data integration and machine learning approaches.\\nProject 2: TrialGraph: Machine Intelligence Enabled Insight from Graph Modeling of Clinical Trials\\nOne of the major impediments to successful drug development is the complexity, cost and scale of clinical trials, particularly large Phase III trials. Despite a wealth of historical data, clinical trial sponsors typically have a difficult time fully leveraging historical trial data to drive insight into optimal clinical trial design, reducing trial cost and scale. Many barriers exist to leveraging this data including drift in clinical terms and procedure over time, differences in trial structure and differences in data sampled. Recent advances in machine learning in areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and graph modeling of complex data have enabled rapid advances in a number of domains. The TrialGraph project seeks to apply these methodologies to clinical trial data, creating a unified graph model to represent clinical trials across phases and therapeutic areas. Such a data modeling approach would enable novel and power analytics that enable efficiencies in drug development and benefit to our patients. Multiple graph modeling initiatives are running in parallel and this project will leverage their infrastructure, graph modeling of external clinical and biomedical data as well as expertise. In collaboration with this wider community, the TrialGraph project will seek to leverage these resources while developing novel graph representations of historical AZ trials, methodologies to analyze these graph representations that provide meaningful insight and experiment with other machine learning methodologies that could yield both novel discoveries and operational efficiencies.\\nProject 3: Algorithm-driven Patient Recruitment: Precision sub-typing of patient populations using \"Super Progressor Phenotypes\"\\nUnderstanding the disease progression, patient-specific clinical trajectories, and factors associated with how patients progress through disease course is an emerging interest to develop precise and effective therapies. Recently, we have combined real-world data and machine learning approaches to develop an algorithm capable of identifying Super Progressors in Non-Alcoholic Steato Hepatitis (NASH). NASH is a poorly characterized disease with a global epidemiologic footprint associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Identifying a patient subset that shows a rapid rate of disease acceleration with a more severe phenotype as “NASH super progressors” is a critical need. This population is of particular interest for AZ Clinical Trials as characterized subpopulation(s) of super progressors will likely have altered Benefit-Risk profiles and could help define novel endpoints. In this project, we propose to explore clinical and real-world evidence datasets, containing insurance claims data, lab values and medical diagnoses and procedures, focused on different disease of interest (type-2 diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease) (GEO, VIVLI, IBM MarketScan, Optum) to develop machine learning models to develop a methodology to characterize subpopulations of NASH patients. There are also opportunities to collaborate with external academic partners on EHR data and joint research with leading clinical research centres in the UK and the US. This work will contribute to an understanding of the factors driving progressors and has the potential to benefit AstraZeneca trials in trial design and patient stratification.\\nProject 4: Finding New Use for New Drug using Digital Drug (Re)positioning: Big data and machine-learning driven indication discovery for new drugs\\nDrug repositioning is defined as a systematic or targeted evaluation of pharmaceuticals to identify new use for existing drugs. AstraZeneca is interested in Drug Positioning/Repositioning technologies for many years, and several of our drugs have a high potential for repositioning. Initially considered to be a niche area, over the years, many Biopharma companies are ramping up their presence in this sector as several COVID-19 related therapies were identified using drug repositioning approaches. With the aid of innovative emerging digital technologies, including data science and artificial intelligence, we are interested in digital drug positioning. We take drugs in various stages of development and identify new indications. Such an approach is a powerful drug development strategy that would help to delineate complex associations between diseases and drugs that mediate biological functions, including pleiotropy. We are building a suite of centralized tools, databases, and methods to augment drug repositioning efforts. Prediction results from computational approaches will be used for downstream experimental validation and function test experiments that would lead to investment decision to launch the new clinical program. Collectively, we are leveraging recent advances in machine intelligence, including deep learning, to develop new ways to enhance drug repositioning investigations. We are also developing systematic drug repositioning and positioning using internal and external data assets.\\nProject 5: Drug Target Discovery using Multi-omics Signatures\\nDrug repositioning is defined as a systematic or targeted evaluation of pharmaceuticals to identify new use for existing drugs.

They have since assembled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.\\n\\nAt Robin AI, we create groundbreaking products that are transforming legal teams. Our work is multi-disciplinary and brings together the best talent in engineering, AI and the law. Our current product uses machine learning to read and comprehend written contracts, assesses whether they adhere to our customers’ preferred positions, and then automatically amends them. But our ambitions go way beyond reviewing contracts – we want to build technology that changes the way companies all over the world do deals.\\n\\nThe legal industry has, thus far, been slow to embrace artificial intelligence. In part this is because the law is a naturally conservative industry, one we think is ready for disruption. But it is also because existing technology has struggled to tackle some of the unique challenges this field presents. Data is usually confidential and so datasets are limited in size. And the legal and financial stakes are high, meaning that high model accuracy and interpretability are especially important. General NLP approaches can perform poorly on legal tasks due to the unusual and precise meanings of particular words and phrases. All of these factors mean that we at Robin AI face a unique set of technical challenges that can only be tackled by creative and cross-disciplinary thinking.\\n\\nThe Role\\nAs a machine learning engineer at Robin, you will be a leader in our ongoing effort to overcome these challenges, as we expand our service across different industries and contract types.\\nTech Stack\\nOur machine learning pipeline is written in Python using PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers models.

Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 7 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 6 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 70,000 riders who deliver orders from 80,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.\\n\\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are already transforming the way people think about food, providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.\\n\\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three-sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauces that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\\n\\nAnd we're just getting started.\\n\\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\\n\\nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.\\n\\nRole\\n\\nThe Staff Machine Learning Engineer will lead the direction and roadmap for our ML platform. Deliveroo is a company driven by ML models and developing a ML platform will help us improve the productivity of our ML engineers and Data Scientists. Some of the key areas we intend to focus on include large scale feature management, model training and serving, pipeline orchestration, notebook environments, data processing, observability and ML experiment management.\\n\\n\\nWhat You'll Do\\n\\nLeadership: You will forge close relationships with the Principal and Staff ML engineers as well as with ML engineering, Engineering and Product Management leaders in multiple organisations at Deliveroo and you will partner with them to deliver impact. You will help define the vision and strategy for the ML platform.\\nPlanning and Execution: Plan and deliver projects that impact multiple organisations.\\nInnovation: Identify opportunities for technological differentiation, investment or divestment. Ensure our organisations work is aligned with broader company objectives.\\nMentorship: Provide mentorship and guidance to younger ML engineers and SWEs.\\nTechnical: Working on hands-on technical problems including design and implementation.\\nRequirements\\nExperience as a hands-on expert-level practitioner of machine learning.\\nExperience leading large ML initiatives across cross functional teams in multiple organisations.\\nTrack record of building and maintaining large scale machine learning systems in production.\\nTrack record of conceiving of significant innovations that result in substantial positive impact to customers.\\nDeep understanding of latest developments of ML systems, techniques, open source and cloud offerings\\n\\nBenefits and Diversity\\n\\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare.
