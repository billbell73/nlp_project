#NLP Project Proposal

## Data Science Job Listing Recommender

### Question/Need

- Data science jobs vary significantly. 
- Also, the language used to describe similar jobs varies.
- Meanwhile data science job vacancies are very numerous.
- It can therefore be a challenge for a data science job candidate to get an understanding of the types of roles there are available, and find roles that might optimally suit them.
- Could a job vacancy recommender help such a candidate?


### Data Description

- Web scraping 5,000+ job live listings on indeed.com and uk.indeed.com
- Each listing has an extensive text description of the job role (most descriptions are 400+ words)
 
### Tools

- Web-scraping: Selenium, Beautiful soup
- Data manipulation: Pandas
- Data storage: MongoDB
- Text preprocessing*: sklearn, NLTK, spaCy, gensim
- Dimensionality reduction*: PCA, SVD, NMF, LDA 
- Visualisations*: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Wordcloud
- Possible webapp: Streamlit

### MVP Goal

- Preliminary topic modelling results, possibly visualised

\* likely to be combination of some/all tools listed
